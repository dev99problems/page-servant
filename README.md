# pages-servant

with specific labels. If by the eod it wasn't updated, the page will be automatically removed.

**Main use case** is when you learn a new course and want to track your progress in retrospect.

* [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com/reference)
* [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/scheduled-event)
