# notion

This package is a wrapper around the Notion API and should expose
basic methods for _finding_ the last **page** in database via **name pattern**,
_creating_ a **next page name** and _creating_ the page itself.

Later on, it's also should be able to find _last created_ page and _delete_ it.
